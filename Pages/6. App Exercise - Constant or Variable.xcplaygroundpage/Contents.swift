 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let Name = "Dean Burwell"; print("I chose a constant for name becasue normaly people do not ever change their names")
var age = 18; print("I choose for the age to be a variable because age changes every year")
var steps = 8000; print("I choose steps to be a variable because the number of stpes a person takes is always increasing")
var goal = 10000; print(" I choose for goal to be a variable becasue the user should be allowed to change their goal to what then want")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
